## Training

Standing Guard Pass to Side Control
 - While standing hold gi by ankles 
 - Push their left leg down with right hand, left knee against side, right foot drives
 - They frame by pushing you away
 - Right knee goes on top of their right leg, rotate around into side control

General ideas
 - Rotate shoulders away from hips to reduce their strength
 - Push shoulders/head up rather than down for more top pressure

## Sparring

Completed 4 rounds, skipped 1. Gassed out hard! 

One submission from top pressure.
